# Mobile and Wireless Systems projects

This repository contains three projects for the **Mobile and Wireless Systems** course of the Alpen-Adria Universit√§t Klagenfurt, winter semester 2023.

## Project 1

The requested task is to study the behaviour of a wireless technology under the effects of *path loss* and *shadowing*, using the [COST231-Hata model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COST_Hata_model).

The studied technology is 5G, using the n1, n2 and n3 frequency bands.
The following parameters for the model are used, accordingly to 3GPP's specifications:
- Transmit power $p_t$: 56 dBm
- Receiver sensitivity $\theta$: -96 dBm
- Transmit height: 40 m
- Receiver height: 3 m
- Frequencies: 1.7 to 2 GHz

The study consists in two parts: and analytical study and a simulation.
